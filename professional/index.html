			<h1>Code</h1>
			<p>My current computer interests are mainly centered around Big Data applications, Network/Systems automation, I'm currently doing some research on Software Defined Networking(SDN),and web technologies. I hope to continually update the blog part of this site with some write-ups about what I am working on in the projects section of the site. I'm committed to Open Source, so you can also visit my <a href="https://github.com/antsankov" target="_blank">Github</a> to see the actual code behind some of the projects I have contributed to or started, including this very <a href="https://github.com/antsankov/antsankov.github.io" target="_blank">site</a>!</p>
