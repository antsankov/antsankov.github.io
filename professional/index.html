			<h1>Code</h1>
			<p>My current computer interests are mainly centered around Big Data applications, Network/Systems automation (currently doing some research on SDN), and web technologies. I hope to continually update the blog part of this site with some write-ups about what I am working on. I'm committed to Open Source, so you can also visit my <a href="https://github.com/antsankov" target="_blank">Github</a> to see the actual code behind some of the projects I have contributed to or started, including this very site!</p>
