I've worked on a few projects. If I thought it turned out well, I've written about it here. Otherwise, see my github.

## [cufcq.com](http://cufcq.com)

I worked with my friend [Sam](untra.io) to take on the school and build a website to summarize CU's teacher survey data. Project highlights:

  - Built on Rails.
  - 23,000+ users and 224,000+ page views.
  - Zero 500 (Internal Server) errors. Not bad for a project started sophomore year.

Find the source code [here](https://github.com/antsankov/cufcq).

## [BroCI](https://github.com/antsankov/BroCI)

During my senior year, I built a continuos integration system from scratch for the Bro intrusion detection system (IDS). This allowed security administrators to virtually test and validate scripts before they deployed them to their Bro cluster.

  - Created a test platform and continuous integration system for a security appliance.
  - Designed and built a pretty dashboard to go along with it.
  - Published a [paper][broci] along the way.

## [PhishMonger](https://github.com/untra/phishmonger)

I worked with some friends to create an incentivized phishing platform during the 2015 Money2020 Hackathon. The pitch: companies would phish their employees, and run a system of corporate prizes that would automatically donate to a charity if the employee reported the link, and deduct money depending on how much information they gave.

  - All made over the course of 24 crazy hours in Las Vegas.
  - Building a good looking and effective phishing page is *stupid* easy.
  - Built a Python wrapper around a crappy API that could only be accessed via Shell commands.
