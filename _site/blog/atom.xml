   <title>Bro-Yanc Integration</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;main-idea&quot;&gt;Main Idea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a year long project I worked with Prof. Eric Keller, Matt Monaco, and Oliver Michel on to integrate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bro.org/&quot;&gt;Bro&lt;/a&gt; intrusion detection system (IDS) into our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ngn-colorado/yanc&quot;&gt;Yanc&lt;/a&gt; SDN controller. My main goal was to implement the ability to change scripts variables on the fly for the same scripts on multiple devices through a single controller unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-used&quot;&gt;Technology Used&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object Oriented Python, Bro IDS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bro.org/sphinx/broccoli-api/index.html&quot;&gt;Broccoli&lt;/a&gt; API, FUSE, Git&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;figcaption&gt; Working with Bro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first serious open source project that I worked on in an academic context. I had had some experience with Bro in my job at our campus Network security office, yet I had never really had any opportunities to create anything with it beyond simple scripts. Working through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bro.org/sphinx/broccoli-api/index.html&quot;&gt;Broccoli&lt;/a&gt; API to interface with Bro through a Python application, I implemented the ability to change multiple scripts in real time from a single controller program. I did this by creating custom Bro modules (think header files) that would be pre-programmed with the information to communicate with the controller unit. This controller program was python application would parse terminal input into global commands for a potential cluster of Bro devices each running the same script but with different variables by device. Imagine you had 4 Bro devices on a network and they each alert you when someone connects to a different IP address. You can change this IP on each of them so they alert you at different times. I had never really used Python classes before, so it was a learning experience coming from the behemoth that is Java OOP. I hope to continue this project into 2015 by implementing a quality of service system regulating how Bro gets its data to run its scripts on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hard-lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Hard Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest learning experience for me on this project was the right way to work with objects. I had originally intended to have a purely functional program, but as I started working with the complex system of sockets that Broccoli uses, I found making connection classes to be far more comprehensible and scalable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;soft-lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Soft Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned how to work with a group on larger open source project in an academic context. I had no idea how important performance testing is, not just to see how well the program works, but whether it even really works at all. Also, much of the functionality I implemented would have only required slight modifications to the Bro Control program. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Coinorado Hackathon</title>
   <link href="http://antsankov.github.io/blog/2014/11/15/coinorado"/>
   <updated>2014-11-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://antsankov.github.io//blog/2014/11/15/coinorado</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;main-idea&quot;&gt;Main Idea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/bitcoin/coin-orado&quot;&gt;Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;, I worked with my roommates &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/untra&quot;&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cdsalazar&quot;&gt;Cris&lt;/a&gt;,
to develop a Bitcoin based &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/antsankov/coinorado_hackathon&quot;&gt;remittence system&lt;/a&gt; to help immigrants send money back to their families that was accessible
through basic SMS messaging. We stayed up for 24 hours and ended up
winning half a bitcoin at the competition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-used&quot;&gt;Technology Used&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twilio, Heroku, Python Flask, Blockchain API, Git&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;img class=&quot;displayed&quot; src=&quot;/pictures/coinorado/coinorado_twilio.png&quot; alt=&quot;Twilio&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;figcaption&gt; Working with Twilio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three aspects of the project that we needed to solve to make
it work: Interfacing with SMS, parsing input, and making the Bitcoin
transactions. To actually receive the messages, I setup an account and
started working with the Twilio API. I redirected these messages to a
Flask server we had set up and were hosting on Heroku that would parse
the information of the SMS string and make the proper calls to the
Blockchain API to handle the actual bitcoin transactions. By the end of
the 24 hour competition we were able to create accounts, check balances,
and send bitcoins all via SMS messages. We probably lost about 6 hours
(25%) of our work by making a bad push to our Heroku server, which
happened to work on our local Flask instance. We started getting an
ominous “Internal Server Error” that not even Heroku’s rollbacks would
fix. Why it happened, we still don’t know. I suspect that there was something bad in our code that would trigger a crash that wouldn’t occur when the server was running locally.This just goes to show how lack of sleep can impair logical
thinking and create negative feedback loops, especially in a group
context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hard-lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Hard Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make Git tags! We lost 25% of our work because we weren’t working with
Git properly, something made more complex by the two origins we were
using for Github and Heroku. If we had had a proper Git tag every hour
or so, we would have had a much easier time spinning up new servers
based on our tags in case of catastrophic failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;soft-lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Soft Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognized how important it is when working in a group to meet often
and debug regularly, the essence of the Agile system. We were far more
productive group programming and discussing our plans in real time as opposed to
working independently in our own bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quanitfying CU's FCQs</title>
   <link href="http://antsankov.github.io/blog/2014/03/16/CU_FCQ"/>
   <updated>2014-03-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://antsankov.github.io//blog/2014/03/16/CU_FCQ</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;main-idea&quot;&gt;Main Idea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a web &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/antsankov/cufcq_dev&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; I worked with my roommates on Sophomore year for our Software Engineering Methods and Tools class. Our school, CU Boulder, collects surveys every semester, called FCQs about teachers and courses that measure average work load, teacher effectiveness, etc. Students can use these to sign up for courses and professors that are more highly rated. We wanted to take this data off of the school website and present it in a more readable format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-used&quot;&gt;Technology Used&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby on Rails, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/antsankov/cufcq_dev/blob/master/csv_make/csv_maker.sh&quot;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt;, Heroku, PostgreSQL, Javascript &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highcharts.com/&quot;&gt;Highcharts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;img class=&quot;displayed&quot; src=&quot;/pictures/cu-fcq/fcq_original.png&quot; alt=&quot;Original FCQ&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; height=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;figcaption&gt;The current official system of FCQs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project we wanted to take what was a pretty difficult to understand interface for this important data and make it more approachable for our fellow students. We broke this project into two main parts: scraping the data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colorado.edu/fcq/&quot;&gt;FCQ website&lt;/a&gt;,and inputting it into our Ruby on Rails server for analysis. I personally worked on the scraping aspect and it involved me downloading the data in 50,000 line excel documents and converting them to properly formatted CSV through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/antsankov/cufcq_dev/blob/master/csv_make/csv_maker.sh&quot;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt; script. Once we had it in this format, we could put it into our PostgreSQL DB and my partner could work on visualizing it using Highcharts. We actually got pretty far conceptually breaking what was originally a single FCQ interface into different ratings for departments, classes, and instructors. As of now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/antsankov/cufcq_dev&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; is dead, but we want to try to restart it by the end of May 2015 so students can make more informed decisions when selecting classes for future semesters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;img class=&quot;displayed&quot; src=&quot;/pictures/cu-fcq/mod_fcq.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our version&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; height=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;figcaption&gt;The same data on our site, over time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hard-lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Hard Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scraping data is really frustrating. When you’re interacting with something that isn’t supposed to be worked with programmatically, in our case the FCQs, you start getting weird errors. Probably one of the most frustrating problems I dealt with was keeping track of the extra commas that were built into the FCQ data which would negatively affect how my computer interpreted the CSVs. If I had known about &lt;a href=&quot;http://openrefine.org/&quot;&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/a&gt; at the time, the project would have been much easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;soft-lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Soft Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to approach the school FCQ office after we finished the class about getting official support for our product and they were unresponsive to say the least. Why we were naively expecting support from academia’s bureaucracy, I still don’t know, but it was a valuable lesson that sometimes making data more available is dangerous to some individuals invested in the status quo. &lt;/p&gt;
