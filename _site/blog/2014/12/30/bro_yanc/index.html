  <h4 id="main-idea">Main Idea</h4>

<p>This was a year long project I worked with Prof. Eric Keller, Matt Monaco, and Oliver Michel on to integrate the <a href="https://www.bro.org/">Bro</a> intrusion detection system (IDS) into our own <a href="https://github.com/ngn-colorado/yanc">Yanc</a> SDN controller. My main goal was to implement the ability to change scripts variables on the fly for the same scripts on multiple devices through a single controller unit. </p>

<p>Object Oriented Python, Bro IDS, <a href="https://www.bro.org/sphinx/broccoli-api/index.html">Broccoli</a> API, FUSE, Git</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>This was the first serious open source project that I worked on in an academic context. I had had some experience with Bro in my job at our campus Network security office, yet I had never really had any opportunities to create anything with it beyond simple scripts. Working through the <a href="https://www.bro.org/sphinx/broccoli-api/index.html">Broccoli</a> API to interface with Bro through a Python application, I implemented the ability to change multiple scripts in real time from a single controller program. I did this by creating custom Bro modules (think header files) that would be pre-programmed with the information to communicate with the controller unit. This controller program was python application would parse terminal input into global commands for a potential cluster of Bro devices each running the same script but with different variables by device. Imagine you had 4 Bro devices on a network and they each alert you when someone connects to a different IP address. You can change this IP on each of them so they alert you at different times. I had never really used Python classes before, so it was a learning experience coming from the behemoth that is Java OOP. I hope to continue this project into 2015 by implementing a quality of service system regulating how Bro gets its data to run its scripts on. </p>

<h4 id="hard-lessons-learned">Hard Lessons Learned</h4>

<p>The biggest learning experience for me on this project was the right way to work with objects. I had originally intended to have a purely functional program, but as I started working with the complex system of sockets that Broccoli uses, I found making connection classes to be far more comprehensible and scalable. </p>

<h4 id="soft-lessons-learned">Soft Lessons Learned</h4>

<p>I learned how to work with a group on larger open source project in an academic context. I had no idea how important performance testing is, not just to see how well the program works, but whether it even really works at all. Also, much of the functionality I implemented would have only required slight modifications to the Bro Control program. </p>
