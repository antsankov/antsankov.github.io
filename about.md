Hi, I'm Alex Tsankov, a developer based in New York City. I graduated from University of Colorado, Boulder (aka CU) where I studied Computer Science and Philosophy.

Professionally, I'm interested in the systems that make running and deploying big software projects possible. Some people call this DevOps and I think it's a lot of fun.

I've also done research in the area of security and software defined networking(SDN). I try to work on side projects that give me chance to branch out of my technical comfort zone. Currently, this includes work with [Ethereum][ethereum] and [Haskell][haskell].

### Contact me

Find me on [Github][github] / [Medium][medium] / [LinkedIn][linkedin] or just send a ```Hello``` to
